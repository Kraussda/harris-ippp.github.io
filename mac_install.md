# Mac Install Instructions

### Terminal
You will need to have a **Terminal** set up on your computer.  If you're running a Mac, it _is_ installed.  Just Spotlight search for 'Terminal.'  Easy!

### Python 
Download the **Python 3.6, 64-bit [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)**, and install it on your computer.
* The Graphical User Interface (GUI) installer is easier -- please use it.
* It may ask for your business email -- you can ignore it.)
* If the installer asks whether or not it can edit your .bashrc, the answer is _yes_.
* When the install is complete, open Terminal and type `python`, then hit `<Enter>`.  It should read `Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda...` a new command prompt.  You can test it out (`1 + 1`, then `<Enter>`) and quit (`quit()` or `ctrl+D` on a Mac).
* Finally exit python (`quit()`) and add a few more (mainly geographic) packages, with this command:
```
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas geopy folium fiona shapely pyproj rtree pysal psycopg2 descartes beautifulsoup4 requests
```
You're done the python part!  Go back to the [main instructions](README.md) to check that the install worked out!!

### Atom Text Editor
I encourage you to use [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) as a text editor; it provides syntax highlighting that you will find useful.  The [Download](https://atom.io/) and installation should be trivial.  If you want, you can delete it when you're done.
* Installing a "de-linter" to find bugs in your code will help a lot.  Go to settings (âŒ˜,) and click on "Install."  Then search for "linter-pylint" and install it with all of the dependencies that come up.  Now whenever you save a python file, it will (partially!!) check your work!
* As an alternative, you may sometimes wantto use Jupyter notebooks or Spyder.  Both of these come with your Anaconda installation.
* Atom requires OS X 10.8 or later.  For 10.6 or 10.7, try Sublime or TextWrangler ([4.5.12](http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html)).

### GitHub 
Create a [**student GitHub account**](https://education.github.com/pack), or just a standard GitHub account.  You will use this account to push (submit) all of your work.  Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* If your OS is more than five years old (10.7 or 10.8), you may need to get your git from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/git-osx-installer/activity/?page=0&limit=100#57cc86a334309d5c609e9fc8); search for version git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg.  If you did the Window Cygwin setup, it should have included git.
* To make submission easier, you should **"create an ssh key" key** for your GitHub account.
  This is just the way that the git encrypts communication (lets you download files);
    `ssh` (secure shell) is the standard way that we make secure connections from the command line.
  Follow GithHub's instructions to 
   1. [generate a new ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-mac)
      * If you have trouble creating the passphrase when the time comes ... don't (just leave it blank/hit return).  By providing the `id_rsa.pub` to GitHub, you're permanently telling it the call and response (Marco/Polo) so that it knows your computer is _you_.  This last piece is not a prerequisite for starting on Monday, but _will_ be necessary, for downloading and starting your homework.
   2. [add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-mac).
      * If `pbcopy` doesn't work, the piece that you'll paste into the GitHub site, is the output of `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

* Tell GitHub who you are, by executing the running the following commands,
    with appropriate substitutions:
  ```
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```
